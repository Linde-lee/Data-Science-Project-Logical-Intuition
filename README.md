**Logical Intuition: Data Science Project**

As part of a university seminar, I completed a self-directed data science project that explored a dataset from a psychology experiment on belief attribution. My goal was to work through the entire data analytic process—from use case exploration to drawing meaningful conclusions using AI methods.
I independently sourced a dataset of philosophical relevance, cleaned and processed it, and applied statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. I taught myself Python and statistics from scratch, using resources like bootcamps, tutorials, and peer feedback. I structured the project to reflect each phase of the analytic pipeline: understanding the experiment behind the data, data cleaning and feature analysis, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression analysis, and finally implementing a basic neural network model.
The biggest challenge was overcoming my lack of prior technical background, but through trial and error, mentorship, and consistent learning, I succeeded. I received top feedback and a grade of 1.0, with my instructor commenting it “exceeded expectations”.
This project not only solidified my interest in AI and data science but gave me confidence in applying analytical tools to abstract, cognitive topics—something I now want to pursue professionally.
